        <h3 class="project-name">TrainingPartner</h3>
        <p class="project-description">Brazillian Jiujitsu is a fun and fast-growing sport, but it can be a bit
          overwhelming for newcomers. I built TrainingPartner top help people new to the game keep track of techniques
          as they learn them, and log information on training sessions to see their progress as the weeks go by.</p>

        <h3 class="project-name">eKnow</h3>
        <p class="project-description">Oblique Solutions, co-created by Brian Eno, is a card set with vague but helpful
          advice designed to help musicians overcome challenges during writing and recording. Leveraging the oblique
          solutions API, I built an app that pairs text from a random card with random imagery, and allows the user to
          muse on how the advice applies to their own situation. It offers users a chance to have a one-way conversation
          with yourself to find perspective, a little like rubber-ducky coding.</p>

        <h3 class="project-name">Who is the One Who Knocks?</h3>
        <p class="project-description">This project is near and dear to me because it's the first thing I ever built in
          JavaScript. It's a simple quiz game where you guess who spoke a series of quotes from Breaking Bad.</p>
